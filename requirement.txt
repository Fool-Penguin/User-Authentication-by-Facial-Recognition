Here is a `requirements.txt` file based on the code skeleton and the tasks it needs to perform.

I've included comments to explain the purpose of each library.

```
# requirements.txt

# For all numerical operations and handling image arrays
numpy

# For camera access, image/video processing, and drawing UI elements
# Also contains the 'cv2.dnn' module for running models
opencv-python

# A high-performance inference engine for running the .onnx models
# (face detector, liveness model, and face recognizer).
# This is generally recommended over cv2.dnn for compatibility and speed.
onnxruntime

# For the face recognition step. Specifically, to easily calculate
# the cosine similarity between face embeddings.
scikit-learn
